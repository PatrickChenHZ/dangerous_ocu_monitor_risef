1. Install the corresponding driver according to the serial communication board you use
   - [CP21xx Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
   - [CH340 Drivers](http://www.wch-ic.com/search?q=ch340&t=downloads)

2. Install the dependent libraries in the following list, the required library files have been placed in the `libdeps` by default, please copy all the files in the`libdeps` directory to `C:\<UserName>\Documents\Arduino\libraries` In the catalog
   - [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI)
   - [Adafruit_DRV2605_Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DRV2605_Library)

3. Configure the TFT header file (**If you use the library file in the `libdeps` directory, you can skip this step**)
   - Find the **TFT_eSPI** directory in your library folder directory
   - Find `User_Setup_Select.h` in the root directory of **TFT_eSPI** and open it for editing
   - Comment out the file header `#include <User_Setup.h>`
   - Find `#includen <User_Setups/Setup26_TTGO_T_Wristband.h>`, cancel the previous comment, save and exit
   - The final effect is as follows:
        ![](../../image/1.jpg)

   - For the new version you need to change the macro definition in `Setup26_TTGO_T_Wristband.h`

       **new version :** `#define ST7735_REDTAB160x80`
      ![](../../image/new_version.png)

       **older version :** `#define ST7735_GREENTAB160x80`
      ![](../../image/older_version.png)

4. The board choose **ESP32 Dev Module**, other settings can be kept as default, note that `T-Wristband` does not use PSRAM, please do not turn on PSRAM, and call PSRAM function

5. For more heart rate examples, please refer to `Adafruit_DRV2605_Library`
